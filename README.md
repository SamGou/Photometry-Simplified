# Photometry Simplified
PS is a tool which simplifies (as the name suggests) the photometry process and the production of colour-magnitude diagrams. It was created to be used with a few other pieces of software:
- AstroImageJ (AIJ)
- TOPCAT
- Excel*

*The aim of PS is to be a better alternative to current amateur photometry approaches and as such it is important that it is free. AstroImageJ and TOPCAT are both free, however Excel isn't. Hence, in the future it will not be required.

## What does PS do exactly?
PS was made to speed up most of the aperture photometry process and the production of colour-magnitude diagrams. Firstly, it allows for easy and automatic star selection in AIJ. Secondly, it automates the calculations required to produce colour-magnitude diagrams, while also allowing conversion of GAIA filters to allow direct comparison between your own measurement data and GAIA's one. 

The automatic star selection has the added benefit when using PS on **clusters**. The process of finding cluster members is relatively simple when PS is used in combination with TOPCAT.
